# Post-MVP Items 6 & 7: Integration Tests and Persistence

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Test Coverage:** 81% overall (1166 statements)  
**New Tests:** 8 tests added (170 total)

---

## üìã Summary

Successfully implemented **end-to-end integration tests** (Item 6) and **lightweight JSON-based persistence** (Item 7) for the AI Gym Assistant application.

---

## üÜï New Files Created

### 1. `src/storage.py` (95 statements, 94% coverage)

**Purpose:** Lightweight JSON-based persistence layer for user profiles and workout/meal plan history.

**Key Features:**
- User profile save/load with automatic file creation
- Workout and meal plan history tracking
- Automatic history trimming (max 20 entries)
- Deduplication by workout/plan ID
- Environment-based configuration:
  - `GYM_ASSISTANT_DISABLE_STORAGE` - Disable persistence (defaults to disabled in tests)
  - `GYM_ASSISTANT_STORAGE_DIR` - Custom storage directory (defaults to `~/.gym_assistant`)
- Storage location: `~/.gym_assistant/state.json`

**Public API:**
```python
class Storage:
    def save_user_profile(profile: UserProfile) -> None
    def load_user_profile() -> Optional[UserProfile]
    def record_workout_summary(workout: Workout) -> None
    def record_meal_plan_summary(plan: NutritionPlan) -> None
    def get_workout_history() -> List[Dict[str, Any]]
    def get_meal_plan_history() -> List[Dict[str, Any]]
```

---

### 2. `tests/test_storage.py` (6 tests)

**Purpose:** Unit tests for the storage module.

**Test Coverage:**

- Tests cross-service interactions (CLI ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Storage)
- Validates persistence behavior in realistic scenarios

**Test Cases:**
1. `test_cli_end_to_end_generates_and_persists`
   - Creates user profile
   - Generates workout and meal plan
   - Verifies storage persistence
   - Checks history recording

2. `test_embedding_service_builds_and_queries`
   - Builds exercise database from exercises
   - Tests similarity search functionality
   - Validates equipment filtering

## üîó Integration with Existing Code

### Updated `src/main.py`

**Changes:**
- Added `Storage` injection into `GymAssistantCLI.__init__()`
- Auto-load user profile from storage on startup
- Persist profile changes automatically
- Record workout and meal plan summaries to history
- Added `_display_history_summary()` method for viewing past plans
- Updated `_set_user_profile()` to handle storage persistence

**New Methods:**
- `_set_user_profile(profile: UserProfile) -> None` - Set and persist profile
- `_display_history_summary() -> None` - Display recent workout/meal history

---

### Updated `tests/conftest.py`

**Changes:**
- Added `autouse` fixture to automatically disable storage during all tests
- Sets `GYM_ASSISTANT_DISABLE_STORAGE=1` environment variable
- Prevents test pollution from file system I/O

---

### Updated `tests/test_main.py`

**Changes:**
- Added `cli_storage_mock` fixture for mocking storage in CLI tests
- Updated existing tests to account for storage integration
- Added test for loading stored profile on CLI initialization

## üîç Technical Details

### Storage File Format

```json
{
  "user_profile": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "weight_kg": 75.0,
    "height_cm": 180.0,
    "fitness_level": "intermediate",
    "goals": ["strength", "muscle_gain"],
    "equipment_access": ["dumbbells", "barbell"],
    "injuries_limitations": []
  },
  "history": {
    "workouts": [
      {
        "workout_id": "workout_123",
        "name": "Upper Body Strength",
        "duration_minutes": 45,
        "difficulty": "intermediate",
        "exercise_count": 5,
        "calories_estimate": 250,
        "target_muscles": ["chest", "back", "shoulders"],
        "created_at": "2025-10-16T10:30:00"
      }
    ],
    "meal_plans": [
      {
        "plan_id": "plan_456",
        "date": "2025-10-16",
        "total_calories": 2200,
        "meal_names": ["Breakfast", "Lunch", "Dinner", "Snack"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Deduplication Logic

The storage system automatically deduplicates entries by their ID:
- Workouts are deduplicated by `workout_id`
- Meal plans are deduplicated by `plan_id`
- New entries with the same ID replace older ones
- History is trimmed to 20 most recent entries

### Environment Configuration

```bash
# Disable storage (default in tests)
export GYM_ASSISTANT_DISABLE_STORAGE=1

# Custom storage directory
export GYM_ASSISTANT_STORAGE_DIR=/path/to/storage

# Default behavior (enabled, ~/.gym_assistant)
# No environment variables needed
```
